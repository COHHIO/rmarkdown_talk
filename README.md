### A Reproducible Workflow and R Markdown
#### October 16, 2019

>"How did I create that? Is this accurate? Could someone else recreate this report or visualization and get the same results?" 
>
>Adopting a reproducible data analysis workflow is important for presenting credible and verifiably accurate data results. With free and open source tools, you can regularly create reproducible data analysis that looks amazing and is easily shared. 
>
>R Markdown combines narrative and chunks of code to generate both text and graphical results. Any R Markdown document can refer to any number of data sources and combine them gracefully into one analysis, shareable via HTML, PDF, or Word. 
>
>The basic principles of a reproducible data analysis workflow will be covered, including ways in which the more academic definition of "reproducible research" must be slightly limited for our purposes since we are working with more sensitive data.
