## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r getprojects}
project <- read.csv("data/Project.csv")
str(project)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r , echo=FALSE}
ggplot(project, aes(ProjectType)) + 
  geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE, bins = 25, aes(fill = ..count..)) +
  theme_bw()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}


```
