## Basic flow of the talk


* forest-level explanation of which part we're thinking about: the data munging between Raw and Visualization. Workflow discussion
* what is markdown
* what is R Markdown
* what is reproducibility
* do not be intimidated by coding b/c you're already doing it
* the role of a versioning tool like git
* a reproducible workflow for our kind (only exploratory data mostly, but still important that everything is correct)

## The Description NHSDC Has

"How did I create that? Is this accurate? Could someone else recreate this report or visualization and get the same results?" 

Adopting a reproducible data analysis workflow is important for presenting credible and verifiably accurate data results. With free and open source tools, you can regularly create reproducible data analysis that looks amazing and is easily shared. 

R Markdown combines narrative and chunks of code to generate both text and graphical results. Any R Markdown document can refer to any number of data sources and combine them gracefully into one analysis, shareable via HTML, PDF, or Word. 

The basic principles of a reproducible data analysis workflow will be covered, including ways in which the more academic definition of "reproducible research" must be slightly limited for our purposes since we are working with more sensitive data.
