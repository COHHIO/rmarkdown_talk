## R Markdown

Slides due September 16th
Questions to ask:

- Does interactive mean I should instruct attendees to follow along at R Studio Cloud or is that too much (I could make it optional)
- I use very few slides because I refer to outside the ppt. It doesn't mean the talk will be too short.

## Resources

- https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/

## Basic flow of the talk

* give option to follow along at R Studio Cloud, talk about R and R Studio VERY BRIEFLY and how using R Studio Cloud bypasses the need to install that
* forest-level explanation of which part we're thinking about: the data munging between Raw and Visualization. Workflow discussion
* what is markdown
* what is R Markdown
* what is reproducibility
* do not be intimidated by coding b/c you're already doing it
* the role of a versioning tool like git
* a reproducible workflow for our kind (only exploratory data mostly, but still important that everything is correct)

## Tasks

* work on R Studio Cloud- either create something or use/modify someone else's
  - it should be about HMIS data
  - it should use sample data
